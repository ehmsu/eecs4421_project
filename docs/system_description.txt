Vehicle Type: Four-Wheeled Skid-Steer Jumping Robot

Key Subsystems:
1. Locomotion — Wheel motors with equal torque. Drive/steer by speed difference.
2. Jump Mechanism — Central spring actuator (single or dual), simulated as a prismatic link force.

Control Parameters:
- k = 800.0  (spring stiffness)
- b = 8.0    (damping)
- l0 = 0.6   (rest length)
- m = 1.5    (mass)
- Fmax = 1500.0  (maximum actuation)
- g = 9.81  (gravity)

Landing Model:
- Contact spring acts as soft ground.
- Optional damping simulates energy loss/harvest.

Simulation:
- Engine: PyBullet
- Time step: 1/240s
